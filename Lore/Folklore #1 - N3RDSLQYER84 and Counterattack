N3RDSLQYER84 and Counterattack:


Backstory:

	This is a story for the generations. A timeless work of art. An unparalleled classic.

	A masterpiece. 

	This is the story of N3RDSLQYER84 and the first Python AC on Counterattack. https://dmoj.ca/problem/ncco4d1p3
	To this day, it continues to amaze, to stun, to inspire people to do the unthinkable. To do the impossible.

	Get your tissues ready. To cry.

The Story:

	N3RDSLQYER84 was feeling good. 
	He just did The Hungary Games (https://dmoj.ca/problem/cco12p2), an exact replica of Counterattack, which he would do today.

	After tweaking the code for a bit, he submitted. AC, AC, AC... TLE??? 
	He managed to pass every case, except for the last one, which was worth 15/92 points. 
	"17pp huh... not bad", he thought. "Maybe the judge is running slow today."

	With this thought in mind, he resubmitted his code. "Hmm...", he thought as it TLE'd again. "Perhaps again?"

	The rest of the day was spent in anguish, resubmitting his code. By the end of it, he was worn out. He was out of ideas.
	He was on the verge of giving up. 

	Slowly, he walked to his room and collapsed into his bed. He closed his eyes.

	But he couldn't sleep.

	In his head, 3 grey letters kept appearing. TLE T L E  T  L  E   T   L   E

	"STOP!", he shouted.
	"What's wrong?", his mom came rushing in.
	"SHUT UP MOM GET OUT MY ROOM", N3RDSLQYER84 roared.

	***

	Without a wink of sleep, N3RDSLQYER84 got out of bed. 
	
	He was up late thinking about Counterattack. Perhaps he had missed something.
	
	The thought followed him all throughout the day. Perhaps...he should have submitted in PyPy2?
	How could the thought have evaded him? He rushed to his computer.

	Out of breath, he opened dmoj.ca. He pasted his code, selected PyPy2, and... clicked submit.

	AC. AC. MLE. MLE. MLE.

	Of course it wouldn't be that simple. Tears started rolling down N3RDSLQYER84's eyes. He collapsed in front of his computer.
	"Of course. Of course. Of course!", he cried. "I was so naiive. So clueless. Maybe some things should be left impossible."

	He raised his head. Then he realized. 

	Even though his code MLE'd... dmoj displayed his output! The answer...it was so near!

	He could feel it. He could sense it. He could smell it. He could touch it. He could...

	HARDCODE IT.

	His tears instantly evaporated. Then, he typed 3 lines of code, which will be respected and studied for centuries to come:
	
	-----------------------
	if n > 1000:
   		print(5729)
    		sys.exit()
	-----------------------

	THE END
